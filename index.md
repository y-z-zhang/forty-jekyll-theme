My name is Yuanzhao Zhang (章元肇). I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Physics at Northwestern University, advised by [Adilson E. Motter](http://dyn.phys.northwestern.edu/). My research focuses on collective dynamics on complex networks. In particular, I am developing theoretical and numerical tools to understand the emergence of intricate synchronization patterns from the decentralized interaction among individual units. I am also actively collaborating with experimentalists to connect my theory with real systems.

**Uniformity out of diversity** - Synchronization among interacting units is a process that underlies the function of many network systems, such as circadian clocks and power grids. It is commonly believed that homogeneity among the units favors uniform dynamics (e.g., global synchronization). Surprisingly, recent studies have found that the opposite can be true. My work aims to characterize the conditions under which synchronization can benefit from heterogeneity and demonstrate this phenomenon for physical and biological systems.

**Cluster synchronization** - Complex networks often support complex synchronization patterns. Understanding such patterns will enable us to manipulate the behavior of numerous biological, social, and technological systems. I work on a general theory and efficient algorithms to identify, characterize, and control synchronization patterns in large networks.

**Chimera states** - One particularly interesting type of cluster synchronization pattern is chimera states, where a network of identically coupled identical oscillators spontaneously splits into coherent and incoherent clusters. It represents symmetry breaking phenomena in networks. I contribute to the understanding of chimera states by characterizing new chimeras and proposing general mechanisms giving rise to such states.
