			<h2>Summary</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Many biological and technological networks show intricate synchronization patterns during normal operations, where several internally coherent but mutually independent clusters coexist. These synchronization patterns are critical to the functions of numerous systems (e.g., information processing in the brain). How to characterize and control such patterns is one of the most fascinating problems in network dynamics.</p>

					<h3>Symmetry-independent analysis of synchronization patterns</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Which synchronization patterns we can ultimately observe in the real world are determined by their stabilities. Building on the mathematical theory of noncommutative algebra, we developed a fast, error-tolerant, and symmetry-independent algorithm to optimally analyze cluster stability under the most general settings.</p>

					<h3>Topological control of synchronization patterns</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In practice, it is often important to be able to control the synchronization patterns without modifying the dynamics of individual nodes. In this work, we proposed a new control strategy based on minimal perturbations of the network structure.</p>
