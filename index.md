My research focuses on developing methods of networks, dynamical systems, and statistical inference, to solve problems in social and biological systems. I try to keep a tight loop between data and theory, and learn a lot from confronting models and algorithms with real problems.
I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2012, advised by Juan G. Restrepo, after which I spent three years as a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health studying the genetic epidemiology of malaria in the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. I then joined the Santa Fe Institute as an Omidyar Fellow until 2017, when I joined the faculty at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Department of Computer Science and the BioFrontiers Institute.
**Networks and theory** - The processes that generate complex networks leave hints about themselves in the patterns of edges, and the relationships between those patterns and vertex metadata. I work on mathematical descriptions of graph ensembles, inference of community structures, vertex ordering or ranking, and using metadata to better understand network formation.
**Malaria's antigenic variation and evolution** - The var genes of the malaria parasite P. falciparum evolve according to complicated and unknown rules, with selective pressures at multiple scales both within hosts and between hosts. I use tools from applied math and statistical physics to understand the structural and evolutionary constraints on var gene evolution, and its their relationships with parasite virulence, population structure, and epidemiology.
**Academic labor market dynamics** - PhDs become faculty each year, but the influences of prestige, advisor, gender, publication record, among other factors, on actual hiring outcomes are not well known, even within individual fields. I investigate inequalities and dynamics of the academic labor market through large-scale data collection and generative models.
