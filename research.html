			<h2>Uniformity out of diversity</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Desipte the common belife that node heterogeneity is deterimental to homogeneous network dynamics, the opposite can be true and, in fact, quite common. One major theme of my research is to undertand when and why uniformity can grow out of diversity in coupled systems.</p>

			<h2>Cluster synchronization</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Complex networks often support complex synchronization patterns. Understanding such patterns will enable us to manipulate the behavior of numerous biological, social, and technological systems. I work on a general theory and efficient algorithms to identify, characterize, and control synchronization patterns in large networks.</p>

			<h2>Chimera states</h2>
		</header>
		<p>One particularly interesting type of cluster synchronization pattern is chimera states, where a network of identically coupled identical oscillators spontaneously splits into coherent and incoherent clusters. It represents symmetry breaking phenomena in networks. I contribute to the understanding of chimera states by characterizing new chimeras and proposing general mechanisms giving rise to such states.</p>
