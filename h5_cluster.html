			<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p>Desipte the common belife that node heterogeneity is deterimental to homogeneous network dynamics, the opposite can be true and, in fact, quite common. One major theme of my research is to undertand when and why uniformity can grow out of diversity in coupled systems.</p>

					<h3>Order out of disorder</h3>
				</header>
				<p>By considering a generic class of limit-cycle oscillators with communication delay, we show that disorder can consistently rescue oscillator networks from losing synchronized rhythm, even when the differences among units are completely random. This suggests that, rather than being eliminated or ignored, intrinsic disorder can be harnessed to help maintain coherent dynamics in technological and biological systems.</p>

				<p>We found that breaking the symmetry in a multilayer network can increase the symmetry of its dynamics.</p>
