I am a fourth year PhD student in Physics at Northwestern University, advised by [Adilson E. Motter](http://dyn.phys.northwestern.edu/). My research focuses on collective dynamics on complex networks. In particular, I am developing theoretical and numerical tools to understand the emergence of complex synchronization patterns from the decentralized interaction among individual nodes. Apart from theoretical work, I am also actively collaborating with experimentalists to bring my findings out of computer screens and into the real world.

**Uniformity out of diversity** - Synchronization among interacting units is a process that underlies the function of many network systems. It is commonly believed that homogeneity among the units is beneficial and often necessary for coherent dynamics to emerge. However, my work shows that the opposite is not only possible but also common in oscillator networks. I am currently working on a theory to elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind this counter-intuitive phenomenon. Such insights can have profound implications for real-world systems whose functions rely on synchronization, including circadian clocks and power grids.

**Cluster synchronization** - Complex networks can support complex synchronization patterns. Understanding such patterns will enable us to manipulate the behavior of numerous biological, social, and technological systems. I work on a general theory and efficient algorithms to identify, characterize, and control complex synchronization patterns.

**Chimera states** - One particular interesting type of cluster synchronization pattern is chimera states, where a network of identically coupled identical oscillators spontaneously splits into coherent and incoherent clusters. It represents symmetry breaking phenomena in networks. I contribute to the understanding of chimera states by characterizing new chimeras and connecting them to other branches of nonlinear dynamics (e.g., riddled basins, stochastic transitions).
