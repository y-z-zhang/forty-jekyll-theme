### Abstract
> A fundamental and widely held assumption on network dynamics is that similar agents are more likely to exhibit similar behavior than dissimilar ones, and that generic differences among them are necessarily detrimental to synchronization.
> Here, we show that this assumption does not hold when communication delay is introduced in a canonical model of agents exhibiting limit-cycle oscillations.
> We demonstrate, in particular, that disorder can consistently rescue oscillator networks from losing synchronized rhythm and spiraling into high-dimensional chaos.
> Remarkably, at intermediate levels, random mismatches are far more effective in promoting synchronization than differences specially designed to facilitate identical synchronization.
> Our results suggest that, rather than being eliminated or ignored, intrinsic disorder can be harnessed to help maintain coherent dynamics in technological and biological systems.
