I am a fourth year PhD student in Physics at Northwestern University, advised by Adilson E. Motter. My research focuses on dynamical processes on complex networks. In particular, I am developing theoretical and numerical tools to understand the emergence of coherent network dynamics from the decentralized interaction among individual nodes. I try to introduce new mathematical tools (e.g., noncommutative algebra) into the study of network phenomena, while establishing connections between novel theoretical finding and real systems by actively collaborating with experimentalists.

**Asymmetry-induced synchronization** -

**Cluster synchronization** - Complex networks can support complex synchronization patterns. Understanding such patterns will enable us to manipulate the proprieties of numerous complex biological, social, and technological systems. I work on a general theory and efficient algorithms to identify, characterize, and control synchronization patterns.

**Chimera states** - One particular interesting type of cluster synchronization pattern is chimera states, where a network of identically coupled identical oscillators spontaneously splits into coherent and incoherent clusters. It represents symmetry breaking phenomena in networks. I discover and investigate novel chimera states, as well as connecting it to other branches of nonlinear dynamics.
