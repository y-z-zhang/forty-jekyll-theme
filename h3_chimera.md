### Abstract
>We report on a new type of chimera state that attracts almost all initial conditions and exhibits critical switching behavior in networks of chaotic oscillators.
>This _switching chimera_ consists of two symmetric chimeras and, despite its global nature, is extremely sensitive to noise---arbitrarily small noise triggers and sustains perpetual switching between the symmetric chimeras.
>The average switching frequency increases as a power law with the noise intensity, which is in contrast with the exponential scaling observed in typical stochastic transitions.
>Rigorous numerical analysis reveals that the critical (i.e., power-law) switching behavior originates from riddled basins associated with the two symmetric chimeras, which in turn are induced by chaos and symmetry in the system.
>Experiments on coupled optoelectronic oscillators demonstrate the genericity and robustness of the global switching chimeras reported here.
>The results have implications for symmetry breaking in dynamical systems and the impact of noise at singular limits.

### Animation
This clip shows the dynamics of a switching chimera state and its space-time plot. The switching between the coherent and incoherent clusters can be triggered by arbitrarily small noise.
