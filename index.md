I am a fourth year PhD student in Physics at Northwestern University, advised by [Adilson E. Motter](http://dyn.phys.northwestern.edu/). My research focuses on dynamical processes on complex networks. In particular, I am developing theoretical and numerical tools to understand the emergence of coherent network dynamics from the decentralized interaction among individual nodes. I try to introduce new mathematical tools (e.g., noncommutative algebra) into the study of network phenomena, while establishing connections between novel theoretical findings and real systems by actively collaborating with experimentalists.

**Uniformity out of diversity** - Synchronization among interacting units is a process that underlies the function of many network systems. It is commonly believed that homogeneity among the units is beneficial and often necessary for coherent dynamics to emerge. However, the opposite is not only possible but also common in oscillator networks. My work tries to establish the generality of this counter-intuitive phenomenon and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

**Cluster synchronization** - Complex networks can support complex synchronization patterns. Understanding such patterns will enable us to manipulate the behavior of numerous biological, social, and technological systems. I work on a general theory and efficient algorithms to identify, characterize, and control complex synchronization patterns.

**Chimera states** - One particular interesting type of cluster synchronization pattern is chimera states, where a network of identically coupled identical oscillators spontaneously splits into coherent and incoherent clusters. It represents symmetry breaking phenomena in networks. I contribute to the understanding of chimera states by discovering new chimeras and connecting them to other branches of nonlinear dynamics (e.g., riddled basins).
